# **Tourism Experience Analytics Using Machine Learning**  

1) **Introduction**  
Tourism is a major global industry that thrives on user experience and personalized recommendations. My project, **"Tourism Experience Analytics Using Machine Learning,"** focuses on analyzing tourist experiences and building a recommendation system that suggests attractions based on user preferences. By leveraging **data analytics, machine learning (ML), and MySQL for data storage**, this project provides valuable insights into user behaviors, preferences, and satisfaction levels to enhance tourism experiences.

2) **Objective**  
The primary objective of this project is to develop a **personalized attraction recommendation system** using **Collaborative Filtering (K-Nearest Neighbors)** and **Content-Based Filtering** techniques. Additionally, it aims to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns in tourist behavior, preferences, and satisfaction levels.  

3) **Technology Stack**  
The project is implemented using:  
- **Python**: For data processing and machine learning.  
- **Streamlit**: To develop an interactive web-based application.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For handling and manipulating data.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing insights.  
- **MySQL Workbench**: For storing and managing structured data.  
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.  

4) **Data Processing & Preprocessing**  

The datasets were **merged** into a single structured database in **MySQL**, and extensive **data preprocessing** was performed, including:  
- Handling **missing values** (imputing them with mean/zero).  
- Removing **outliers** using statistical methods.  
- Performing **feature engineering** to enhance recommendation accuracy.  

5) **Machine Learning Approach**  
 **1. Collaborative Filtering (KNN-Based Recommendation System)**  
- Uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to find similar users based on their ratings.  
- Predicts attractions based on the preferences of similar users.  
- **Challenge**: Missing values (NaNs) in the user-item matrix were handled using **mean imputation or zero-filling**.  

 **2. Content-Based Filtering**  
- Analyzes attraction descriptions, tourist interests, and reviews.  
- Uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to recommend attractions based on similarity scores.  

6) **Results & Insights**  
- The **recommendation system** suggests attractions tailored to user interests.  
- **EDA reveals** insights such as peak tourist seasons, attraction popularity, and user sentiment.  
- **Visualizations** highlight key trends, such as **which demographics prefer which types of attractions**.  

7) **Challenges & Solutions**  
1. **Duplicate User Entries**: Resolved by aggregating duplicate ratings.  
2. **Sparse Ratings Matrix**: Filled missing values with **0 or column mean** to ensure proper model training.  
3. **Handling Large Data**: Optimized SQL queries for efficient data retrieval.  

8) **Conclusion**  
This project successfully applies **machine learning** and **data analytics** to the tourism industry, offering personalized recommendations that enhance user experience. The use of **MySQL for structured data management, EDA for insights, and KNN-based collaborative filtering** ensures an effective and efficient system. This project not only contributes to improving tourism experiences but also demonstrates a strong application of **data science and machine learning concepts**.

**future improvements planned:** The system can be extended to real-world travel agencies, enhancing user engagement and customer satisfaction through AI-driven recommendations.
